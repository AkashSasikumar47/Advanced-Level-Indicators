Fibonacci Retracement is a powerful tool for identifying potential support and resistance levels based on key Fibonacci ratios, such as 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. These levels can act as price reversal points, helping traders make decisions on entry and exit points.

4. Combine Fibonacci Retracement with other technical indicators for confirmation.

### Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse)
