### Fibonacci Retracement

Fibonacci Retracement is a powerful tool for identifying potential support and resistance levels based on key Fibonacci ratios, such as 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. These levels can act as price reversal points, helping traders make decisions on entry and exit points.
